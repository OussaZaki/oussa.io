When we first get introduced to programming, in addition to variables, conditions, and loops. We get to meet functions, the instrument responsible for performing a set of defined tasks to serve an end, or to serve a 'function.' So what exactly is a function? How do computers handle functions? Do we even need functions?

Let's start with the most straightforward question. Do we even need functions? Yes!

## So what exactly is a function?

I remember back in the days when my parents started including me in house duties. For example, I had my mom walking me through how to set up and run the laundry machine. She'd first start by showing me how to sort the clothes properly, by color, then by fabric type. Then she'd ask me to load the machine, choose a suitable program, and finally press start.

Well, that right there was the laundry function. Sorting clothes, loading the machine... are all functions as well.

Functions are the enchanting block that holds our ideas and our reasoning in the form of instructions.
