Few fonts capture the elegance and complexity of the Arabic language while playing with modern geometric design.
[Zaatar](https://boharat.com/zaatar/), a font designed by [Tawfiq Dawi](https://www.heyporterposter.com/) and [Abdo Mohamed](https://abdomohamed.com/), captures this balance perfectly.

    <blockquote className="font-serif italic leading-relaxed">
        &ldquo;
        <p>Zaatar is a dynamic Arabic typeface abstracted from a mixture of Arabic Ruq'ah and Nastaliq, the slanted baseline with a geometrical contemporary touch, manifest a strong contrast between thick and thin strokes, present a retro-futuristic impression yet an Arabic calligraphic seriousness.</p>

For this poster, I made a few adjustments to the original typefont, aligning the shapes with a focus on geometryâ€”an obsession of mine. It's amazing how these small tweaks can bring a sense of order to the natural flow of the script, highlighting the harmony between structure and creativity in Arabic design. This piece feels like a celebration of that balance.

This project is not just a tribute to a typeface; it's an homage to the harmony between structure and creativity in Arabic design.
