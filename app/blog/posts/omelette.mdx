In the grand symphony of morning rituals, the humble omelette emerges as the maestro of controlled chaos—a culinary haiku composed of shattered shells and whispered hopes. Cracking eggs becomes an existential act, each yolk a sun collapsing into the cosmic abyss of your mixing bowl. As you whisk, you're not just blending ingredients; you're summoning the primordial forces that once stirred the stars, all to pour them into a sizzling pan where alchemy and ambition collide.

But beware, for the omelette is a mercurial masterpiece, a delicate tapestry woven with threads of timing and audacity. Flip too soon, and you've birthed a scrambled enigma; wait too long, and you're left with a crusted relic lamenting opportunities lost. Fold it gently, as if tucking in the very fabric of space-time, and slide it onto your plate—a golden crescent that tastes like victory and vaguely of onions. Thus, in the act of omelette-making, we find not just breakfast, but a delicious metaphor for the absurdity and wonder of existence itself.

Man I love omelettes.
